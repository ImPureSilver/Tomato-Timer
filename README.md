# Tomato-Timer
A timer for productivity.

# Goal
The goal of this app was to make work/break study sessions
much easier to manage with an app that isn't distracting in 
and of itself with ads and annoying banners to get you to use the app.

# Reasoning for this app
I myself have noticed that if a timer application has a notification banner,
then I am more likely to run off into another app since I look at the timer
and I say to myself, "Ah, I have more time left. I'll just browse around <insert social media app here>"
and end up eating up precious productive time, so to fix this, I made my own app in which I'll have to
keep open to see the timer count and if I leave it, I'll only be left with a small notification alert in
the notification drawer to remind me that I should be working.
