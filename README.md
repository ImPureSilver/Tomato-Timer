# Tomato-Timer
A simplistic and to the point pomodoro timer for productivity.

# Demo of app here

# Goal
The goal of this app was to make work/break study sessions
much easier to manage with an app that isn't distracting in 
and of itself with ads, annoying banners to get you to use the app (so they earn money from seeing the ad).
However, the only annoyance to this is that the app's alert is made to bring you back into the app
so you can get back to being productive.

# Who does this help?
This was originally made for myself to prevent me from straying away from learning DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms)
to do other things other than that. Also, this can be pitched to those with ADD/ADHD since this has been a help
from a friend of mine that opted in to use the app fulltime for me.
